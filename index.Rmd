## Defining the region

CRCOG region as a basis - Hartford + 29 surrounding towns.

## Population growth ##

What has been the population change in West Hartford since 1970?

1. _-7%_
2. 7%
3. 14%
4. 28%

*** .hint

In 1970, the population of West Hartford was 68,031. 

*** .explanation

It has gone from 68K to 63K. The projected population through 2025 is just under 63K.

## Poverty ##

Fewer people lived in poverty in Hartford in 2000 than in 1990. Is this good news or bad news? Explain your answer. 

1. Good news
2. _Bad news_

*** .hint

37,000 people lived in poverty in Hartford by 2000. 

*** .explanation

During this period, population loss was faster than the increase in poverty. Poverty thus became more concentrated in the city during this decade - many people left the city, some of them poor. The current poverty rate for the city is 38 percent, among the highest in the country.

## Suburbanization of poverty

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 12}

                population = sum(population), 
                population.under.poverty = sum(poppoverty),
                median = median(medianfamilyincome, na.rm = T),
                min = min(medianfamilyincome, na.rm = T),
                max = max(medianfamilyincome, na.rm = T))

ggplot(aes(y = population.under.poverty, 
           x = period), data = subset(gh_sum,period >= 1970 & period <= 2010)) +

## School enrollment ##

What proportion of area students go to school outside their 'home' district?

1. 1 in 20
2. 1 in 10
3. _1 in 6_
4. 1 in 5
5. 1 in 4

*** .hint

This includes charter schools, magnet schools, private and parochial schools, home-schooling, vocational schools, etc. 

*** .explanation

16% (or 1 in 6) of students in the region attend school outside their home district, either through magnets, charters, open choice, private schools or other alternatives. However, there is substantial variation across towns and by grade level, with almost half of students leaving the home district in Bloomfied by high school.

## Linguistic diversity ##

Which school district has the most languages spoken by its students?

1. East Hartford
2. Hartford
3. Rocky Hill
4. _West Hartford_
5. Wethersfield

*** .hint

46 languages are spoken in this district (according to 2010-11 SDE data), although other sources report [higher figures](http://www.hellowesthartford.org). 

*** .explanation

West Hartford has the most languages, followed by Hartford. Hartford has the highest percentage of ELL students though, followed by East Hartford.

## Globally connected region ##

Which of the following is _not_ among the top 5 languages spoken in Hartford Public Schools?

1. Albanian
2. _Creole-Haitian_
3. Karen
4. Portuguese

## Workforce skills ##

Connecticut is forecasted to need what percent middle-skills workers by 2020?

1. 18%
2. _28%_
3. 38%
4. 48%

30% of jobs are forecasted to be low-skills jobs. 

*** .explanation

The Center for Education and the Workforce at Georgetown forecasts CT jobs to requires 30% low skills (no college), 28% middle skills (some college or credential) and 42% high skills (college or higher). Job growth is forecasted to occur by roughly the same percentages.
